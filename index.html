	 <p>Once lived on the moon for 600 years and only ate moon rocks, because well, 
	 there isn't much else to eat up there, am I right?</p>
	 <p>Had 2000 Federal agents looking for me because they thought I was selling fake paradas
	 to unsuspecting victims. They later found out they had the wrong John Gay, the one they were looking
	 for lived in Los Angles, the capital of fake ish</p>
	 <p>Once had to fight off a bear back in the Vietnam war. Let me tell you, that is no easy job, almost
	 died in those jungles of Nam. The shellshock still come back every once in a blue moon, but they gave me
	 a purple heart for it.</p>
	 <p>Went to woodstock and met Jimi Hendrix, dude was far out and way ahead of his time on the social
	 issues. Sometimes I wonder what the landscape of music would be today if he were still alive</p>
	 <p>Has an access to a time machine and is mortal, how else could any of this be remotely possible?</p>
	 <p>Basketball is a great sport, so is boxing. More people should watch those sports in my opinion, I think
	 eventually, people will watch anything and everything on a mobile device. The tapwater in Flint, Michigan is stil
	 contaminated with lead and toxic waste. Its has been years since they've had uncontaminated water. This is a crisis
	 that is unacceptable, because it is happening in America. Someone should fix the pipes and help the people, bottled
	 water is not enough. Someone needs to do something about that.  </p>
